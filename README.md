# Email Spam/Ham Classification System
# Overview
This project is a machine learning-based email spam classification system using a dataset of over 5500 spam and ham (non-spam) emails. The system uses Python for text classification and applies various algorithms to identify spam emails. The system is built using TF-IDF vectorization and feature selection techniques, followed by training with Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.

# Features
* Text Pre-processing: Cleans and prepares email data for modeling.
* Feature Extraction: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
* Feature Selection: Uses Best First Feature Selection to improve model performance.
* Model Training: Trains classifiers including Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
* Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
* Predictive System: Classifies new emails as spam or ham.

# Conclusion
This email spam classification system successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to identify spam emails with high accuracy. By employing TF-IDF vectorization and feature selection, and evaluating with Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers, the project achieves the following results:

- Naive Bayes Accuracy: 98.39%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 96.71%
These results showcase the effectiveness of the system in distinguishing between spam and ham emails. The Naive Bayes model, in particular, delivers excellent performance, making it a reliable choice for email classification tasks.

# Key Insights:
- High Accuracy: Both models perform well, with Naive Bayes slightly outperforming the Decision Tree.
- Effective Feature Engineering: TF-IDF and feature selection contribute significantly to model performance.
- Practical Application: The system provides a robust solution for filtering spam emails, potentially enhancing email communication efficiency and security.


Future work may involve exploring additional models, fine-tuning existing ones, or integrating more advanced feature extraction methods to further improve accuracy and robustness.
